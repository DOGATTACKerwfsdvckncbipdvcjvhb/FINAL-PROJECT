# FINAL PROJECT
Final project 

## Introduction
This code file is to make npcs with random traits for an open world video game. The generator can produce an NPC with a special trait that makes them stand out, the intensity of that trait, if the character is a pet, the age of the character, the height and if the character is young or old.

## Libraries used
The math, random, and time libraries were used in this code
`code`
        import math
        import time
        import random

These were used to make the code readable while it printed out the output, random was used to make random numbers and chances. While the math was used for rounding down and up.

## Configuration
The program is not that configurable however you can still change the variables and if statements, you may have to delete some if statements because they may cause errors.


## Highlights
If the boolean variable in the code is not true, the age and the height of the character will not be the same if the pet boolean is true. The max will change with a different value of said variable. The program uses a large function so it does not need to be typed many times if it is needed somewhere else.

## Readability
Every line of code has a comment explaining what the line of code does, and between each line of code is a new line to make it less cramped. Dupilicates do not have comments.

## Example input and output
    Input amount of npcs(1 to 30): 2

    NPC 1
    Special characteristic: Naive
    Intensity of trait(10 is intense): 1.1
    is a pet: False
    Age of the human NPC: 54
    The height is   5.5   ft
    Character is old
